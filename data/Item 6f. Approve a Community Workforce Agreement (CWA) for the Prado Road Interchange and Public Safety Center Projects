Item 6f 
Based on an extensive stakeholder outreach process and a detailed review of past City 
Capital Improvement Program (CIP) projects, staff believes implementation of a CWA for 
these two large projects would help advance Council’s primary objective of increasing 
employment of local residents on the covered projects. 
 
The agreement outlines basic terms related to union activities, project labor procurement 
and referral protocols, work stoppage, wages and benefits, management rights, dispute 
resolution, covered employees, and other terms identified in Articles 1 -20 of the CWA and 
the related attachments.  The CWA was negotiated by negotiating teams representing 
the City and the Trades Council following direction provided by City Council on April 19 
and July 19, 2022.  
 
DISCUSSION 
 
1. Background 
 
1.1. Workforce Agreement Task in Major City Goal 
With the adoption of the 2021 -23 Financial Plan, Council established a Major City Goal 
(MCG) of Economic Recovery, Resiliency, and Fiscal Sustainability. To help achieve this 
goal, Council outlined a specific task to research methods to support the participation of 
local contractors, local vendors, and local labor in public projects through workforce 
agreements, local purchasing requirements, and alternative project delivery methods. 
This work effort has been broken into three general phases: 
 
Phase 1 (complete). Council Study Session to provide input and guidance on the 
work effort and develop a project plan based on Council feedback. The Study 
Session was held in September 2021. 
 
Phase 2 (complete). As framed by input and guidance from the p hase one Study 
Session, develop a policy framework for Community Workforce Agreements 
(CWAs), alternative project delivery, and local purchasing.  Within this policy 
framework, identify CWA negotiating objectives for Council consideration. 
 
Phase 3 (current phase). Council consideration of programs and policies, and 
direction for implementation of the same. 
 
This report focuses on the negotiation and proposed implementation of a CWA. 
 
1.2. Definition and Purpose of a CWA 
CWAs, sometimes referred to as Project Labor Agreements, or Project Stabilization 
Agreements, are "pre-hire" collective bargaining agreements between a project owner, 
contractors and building and construction trade unions.  A CWA establishes standard 
terms and conditions of employment for a qualified construction project, including work 
conditions, hiring procedures, wages and benefits, management rights, dispute resolution 
procedures, and procedures to prevent work stoppages.   
Page 158 of 1069
Page 2
Item 6f 
In addition, CWAs often include provisions to promote participation in covered projects by 
targeted workers and demographics, including residents, apprentices, historically 
underutilized or underrepresented groups, and veterans.  CWAs may apply to a single 
project, projects with budgets over a specified threshold, projects of a specific type, or all 
projects undertaken by a project owner.  Once adopted, CWAs are included in the bid 
documents for covered projects, and the provisions apply to the prime contractor, 
subcontractors of every tier, and workers for which prevailing wage determinations have 
been established by the California Department of Industrial Relations. 
 
1.3. City Experience with a CWA 
The City previously negotiated and entered a CWA with the Tri-Counties Building and 
Construction Trades Council (Trades Council) for the SLO Water Plus Project (i.e., WRRF 
Upgrade) in December 2018 to advance the objective defined by the Council of 
maximizing local employment.  This was the first such agreement the City has approved 
and included a local worker participation goal of 30%. 
By September 2022, approximately 83% of all labor hours (approximately 161,400 local 
hours out of 195,250 total hours) on the SLO Water Plus Project have been performed 
by workers residing in San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Monterey, and Ventura Counties 
(defined in the CWA as "local workers"), representing a significant reinvestment of 
construction expenditures into the local economy.  Table 1 presents the labor hours 
worked by residents of each tier on the SLO Water Plus Project.

1.4. CWA Alignment with Major City Goal  
The City's ongoing Capital Improvement Program (CIP) includes several large 
construction projects that will provide the infrastructure required for economic vitality, 
neighborhood wellness, transportation, and public safety.  These public projects present 
an opportunity to continue enhancing the employment of residents by implementing a 
CWA with the Trades Council that includes a local worker participation goal.

Item 6f 
1.5. Previous Council Direction 
A Study Session was held on September 21, 2021, to present strategies identified by staff 
to support the local economy. The Study Session included a guided discussion with a 
series of questions intended to determine Council’s preferred strategies and 
implementation priorities, and to inform the subsequent phases of the work program.  The 
following feedback/direction was provided to staff during the Study Session: 
 
1. Council supported analysis and implementation of the draft strategies as separate 
work efforts. 
2. Council confirmed that its primary objective in considering impl ementation of a 
more broadly applicable CWA is to prioritize employment of local workers. 
3. Council recommended using the SLO Water Plus CWA as a model for a future 
CWA. 
4. Council recommended the CWA evaluation include consideration of appropriate 
cost thresholds and types of projects for inclusion in the CWA. 
5. Council identified additional stakeholders to be included in the stakeholder 
outreach effort. 
 
Following the Study Session, staff performed extensive stakeholder outreach and 
analyzed actual local hiring totals for a representative group of past City CIP projects to 
determine historical local worker participation and inform recommended CWA negotiating 
objectives.  The stakeholder outreach process, historical CIP project review, and the 
resulting staff recommendations were presented to Council on April 19, 2022.  The 
following feedback/direction was provided to staff during the April 2022 Council meeting: 
 
1. Staff was authorized to negotiate a CWA with the Trades Council to include the 
Cultural Arts District Parking Structure (vertical construction component only), 
Prado Road Interchange, and Public Safety Center projects, including a 60% local 
worker participation goal and excluding prevailing wage services provided through 
professional services agreements; 
2. The deadline to reach an agreement with Tri-Counties Building and Construction 
Trades Council is July 19, 2022, for the three legacy projects; 
3. Staff should revisit CIP projects that could benefit from a CWA with each 2 -year 
Financial Plan; 
4. Staff should continue to track use of local workers in all CIP projects as part of key 
performance indicators; 
5. Staff should revisit the continued use of CWAs after bidding of last legacy project; 
and 
6. Staff should ensure the trades and businesses continue to coordinate with Cal 
Poly, Cuesta, Hancock and high schools for workforce development. 
 
After the April 2022 Council meeting, staff initiated negotiations with the Trades Council; 
however, the City and Trades Council negotiating teams were unable to reach tentative 
agreement by the July 19, 2022, deadline established by Council (the negotiation process 
is described in greater detail in the following section of the report). A summary of the 
negotiation status and outstanding issues was presented to Council on July 19, 2022. 
Page 160 of 1069
Page 4
Item 6f 
The following feedback/direction was provided to staff during the July 2022 Council 
meeting: 
 
1. Based on the substantive differences on three issues of significance and the time 
constraints surrounding the bidding and contracting associated with the Cultural 
Arts District Parking Structure, Council acknowledged that the CWA would not 
apply to the Cultural Arts District Parking Structure in order to remain on schedule; 
and 
2. Staff should continue to dialogue with the Trades Council for the Prado Road 
Interchange and Public Safety Center projects to determine if progress could be 
made on the open issues. 
 
In accordance with Council’s direction, staff re-engaged with the Trades Council to reach 
consensus on the outstanding issues as described further below. 
 
2. Negotiation Process 
 
CWA negotiations began in June 2022 following Council direction provided at the April 
2022 Council meeting.  The City Attorney’s office formed a negotiating team compr ised 
of the City Attorney, Mike Vlaming of Vlaming and Associates, and Justin Pickard of Water 
Systems Consulting, Inc., with support from Assistant City Manager Shelly Stanwyck and 
Public Works Director Matt Horn.  Mr. Vlaming and Mr. Pickard were include d in the 
negotiating team based on their expertise with CWAs and their previous experience 
supporting the City during negotiations for the SLO Water Plus Project.  The Trades 
Council’s negotiating team included Ray Van der Nat, the attorney for the Trades Council; 
Joshua Medrano, the Executive Secretary of the Trades Council; and Martin Rodriguez, 
Business Agent for the Iron Workers Union Local 433. 
 
The SLO Water Plus CWA was used as the model for negotiating the new agreement, 
which streamlined the negotiating process and allowed the negotiating teams to identify 
key issues on which to focus discussions in a relatively short timeframe.  A draft CWA 
provided by the Trades Council in March 2022 was reviewed by the City’s team and a 
counterproposal was prepared and transmitted to the Trades Council prior to the first 
negotiation meeting held on June 23, 2022.  Following the negotiation meeting, the 
Trades Council transmitted their first counterproposal, which was followed shortly by a 
counterproposal from the City and a best and final proposal by the Trades Council. 
 
The negotiating teams were unable to reach agreement on several issues prior to the July 
19, 2022, deadline for inclusion of the Cultural Arts District Parking Structure Project in 
the agreement as detailed in the July 19th Council Agenda Report.  The City’s negotiating 
team re-initiated negotiations with the Trades Council after the July 2022 Council meeting 
in accordance with Council’s direction, and tentative agreement was ultimately reached 
during a negotiation meeting held on November 30, 2022.

Item 6f 
3. Key Provisions 
 
The following sections detail several key provisions included in the final, negotiated 
CWA included in this report as Attachment A. 
 
1.6.  Core Workers 
CWAs designate trade unions as the exclusive source of craft labor on covered projects 
and union referral systems must be used exclusively by the general contractor and 
subcontractors of all tiers to obtain craft labor.  The CWA includes provisions that allow 
local (based in the City of San Luis Obispo or San Luis Obispo County), non -union 
contractors to directly employ up to three of their long-standing, or “core workers,” before 
being required to use the union referral system.  After employing three initial core workers, 
local area contractors can continue employing core workers on a one -to-one ratio with 
union referrals until a maximum of seven core workers have been employed. After seven 
core workers have been employed, any additional employees must be obtained through 
the standard union referral system.  Non-local, non-union contractors can employ core 
workers on a one-to-one ratio with union referrals until a maximum of five core employees 
is reached.  These core worker provisions will preserve the ability of non -union 
contractors to continue utilizing their key staff on covered projects. 
 
1.7. Local Worker Participation 
Pursuant to Council direction, the City’s primary objective in negotiating a CWA with the 
Trades Council was to maximize employment opportunities on several of the City’s largest 
CIP projects for local residents.  The CWA includes provisions that allow unions to 
prioritize referral of local residents when workers are dispatched to covered projec ts, 
rather than following normal referral procedures which are typically based on an “out -of-
work list” (i.e., workers who have been waiting the longest to be dispatched to a project 
are the first to be referred).  This prioritized dispatch of local workers is not possible absent 
a CWA.  A 50% local worker participation goal is included in the proposed CWA. 
 
1.8.  Construction Inspection, Materials Testing, and Land Surveying 
Construction inspection, materials testing, and land surveying services procured by the  
City through professional services agreements are excluded from coverage by the CWA.  
While prevailing wage determinations have been established for these crafts, the services 
are considered critical quality assurance and quality control functions that he lp ensure 
City control over project quality, budget, and schedule.  Exclusion of these services from 
coverage by the agreement will preserve City control over essential QA/QC functions and 
help mitigate concerns raised by professional services providers during the stakeholder 
outreach process.  Should inspection, materials testing, or land surveying services be 
procured by the general contractor or subcontractors, these services would be covered 
by the agreement.   
  
Page 162 of 1069
Page 6
Item 6f 
1.9.   Work Stoppages 
The CWA includes provisions expressly prohibiting strikes, picketing, work stoppages, 
slowdowns, and lockouts to prevent interruptions to the work, with limited exceptions.  
While work stoppages have been infrequent among construction trade unions in recent 
years, work stoppage and dispute resolution provisions in the CWA will help ensure 
continuation of work on covered projects in the event of a strike. 
 
1.10. Community Workforce Coordinator 
The City will designate a Community Workforce Coordinator to administer the CWA on 
its behalf for the covered projects.  The Community Workforce Coordinator would be an 
outside consultant with specific experience administering CWAs, and would  work with the 
general contractors, subcontractors, and trade unions to implement the requirements of 
the agreement and help the parties achieve the established local worker participation 
goal.  The Community Workforce Coordinator can also perform key labor compliance 
functions to reduce the administrative burden on City staff and monitor contractor 
compliance with California Labor Code requirements. 
 
4. Summary and Recommendation 
The final, negotiated CWA reflects concessions by both the City and the Trades Council; 
however, the agreement meets Council’s primary goal of maximizing employment of local 
workers on several of the City’s largest CIP projects.  The City Attorney’s office and Public 
Works staff will collaborate with the Trades Council, affiliated unions, and project 
contractors to successfully implement the agreement and meet the local worker 
participation goals. 
 
Staff recommends Council authorize the Mayor to enter into a Community Workforce 
Agreement in a final form approved by the City Attorney (substantially in the form provided 
as Attachment A) with the Tri-Counties Building and Construction Trades Council, AFL-
CIO and the Signatory Craft Councils and Unions for the Prado Road Interchange and 
Public Safety Center projects.  
 
Public Engagement 
 
Extensive public engagement and stakeholder outreach was performed in winter 2021/22 
and spring 2022 as part of the CWA evaluation that culminated with the April 19, 2022, 
City Council Meeting and Council Agenda Report.  Feedback from the stakeholder 
outreach process was used to inform the negotiation objectives approved by Council 
which are reflected in the final, negotiated agreement.   
 
CONCURRENCE 
 
The Administration Department, City Attorney, and Community Services Group concur 
with the recommendations of this report.

ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW  
 
The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) does not apply to the recommended 
action in this report, because the action does not constitute a “Project” under CEQA 
Guidelines Section 15378.

Total: $70,655  $32,758  
 
The appropriated budget for FY2022-23 allocated $70,655 in operating budget to hire 
necessary consultant support for this ongoing effort, with costs proportionally shared 
between the General Fund and three enterprise funds – Water, Sewer, and Parking. To 
date, $37,897 has been expended to cover consultant cost s. Budget has been reserved 
for implementation of the CWA based upon Council’s preferred action, including work to 
develop procedures for implementation of CWAs on covered projects. The costs of 
implementation in the long term, which include consultant support for CWA contract 
oversight during project construction, would be applied to the covered Capital Projects 
and be incorporated into the project construction budget. Estimated administrative costs 
of a CWA range from 0.25% to 5% of total construction cos t, with lower percentages for 
large multi-year projects such as the Prado Road Interchange and Public Safety Center 
projects.  
ALTERNATIVES 
 
Elect not to enter into the CWA with the Tri Counties Building and Construction 
Trades Council. Council may choose not to approve execution of the CWA at this time.  
Council may select this alternative if it believes additional negotiations with the Trades 
Council are warranted or if a CWA would not benefit future City CIP projects.  This 
alternative is not recommended as the final, negotiated agreement is anticipated to help 
realize Council’s goal of increasing local worker participation on the covered projects.

ARTICLE 1 
INTENT AND PURPOSE 
 
Section 1.1 Identification and Retention of Skilled Labor and Employment of Local Area 
Residents:  The construction and capital improvement work scheduled to be performed by the 
City will require large numbers of craft personnel and other supporting workers. The parties 
understand and intend to use the opportunities provided by the extensive amount of work to be 
covered by this Agreement to identify and promote, through cooperative efforts, programs and 
procedures (which may include, for example, programs to prepare persons for entrance into 
formal apprenticeship programs, or outreach programs to the community describing 
opportunities available as a result of the Project), the interest and involvement of Local Area 
Residents in the construction industry; assist them in entering the construction trades, and 
through utilization of the approved apprenticeship programs, provide training opportunities for 
those Local Area Residents and other individuals wishing to pursue a career in construction.  
Further, with assistance of the Community Workforce Coordinator, the City, the Contractors, the 
Unions and their affiliated regional and national organizations, will work jointly to develop and 
implement procedures promptly for the identification of craft needs, the scheduling of work to 
facilitate the utilization of available craft workers, and to secure the services of craft workers in 
sufficient numbers to meet the high demands of the Project Work to be undertaken. 
 
Section 1.2  Encouragement of Local Area Contractors:  The Project will provide many 
opportunities for local contractors and suppliers to participate, and the parties therefore agree that 
they will cooperate with all efforts of the City, the Community Workforce Coordinator, and other 
organizations retained by the City for the purpose of encouraging and assisting the participation 
of such businesses in Project Work. The parties shall ensure that the provisions of this 
Agreement do not inadvertently establish impediments to the participation of Local Area 
Contractors and Local Area Residents. 
 
Section 1.3 Project Cooperation:  The Parties recognize that the construction to take place 
under this Agreement involves unique and special circumstances which dictate the need for the 
Parties to develop specific procedures to promote high quality, rapid and uninterrupted 
construction methods, and practices.  The smooth operation and cost effective, successful and 
timely completion of the work is vitally important to the City.  The Parties therefore agree that 
maximum cooperation among all parties involved is required; and that with construction work of 
this magnitude, with multiple contractors and crafts performing work on multiple sites over an 
extended period of time, all Parties agree to work in a spirit of harmony and cooperation, and 
with an overriding commitment to maintain the continuity and timely completion of Project 
Work.  
 
Section 1.4 Workers' Compensation Carve-out:  Further, the Parties recognize the potential 
which the Project may provide for the implementation of a cost-effective workers' compensation 
system as permitted by California Labor Code, Section 3201.5, as revised.  Should the City 
request, the Union parties agree to meet and negotiate in good faith with representatives of the 
City for the development, and subsequent implementation, of an effective program involving 
improved and revised dispute resolution and medical care procedures for the delivery of 
workers’ compensation benefits and medical coverage as permitted by the Code.

Section 1.5 Peaceful Resolution of All Disputes:  In recognition of the special needs of the 
Project and to maintain a spirit of harmony, labor-management peace and stability during the 
term of this Community Workforce Agreement, the Parties agree to establish effective and 
binding methods for the settlement of all misunderstandings, disputes and grievances; and in 
recognition of such methods and procedures, the unions agree not to engage in any strike, 
slowdowns, interruptions, or disruption of Project Work, and the contractors agree not to engage 
in any lockout, or any other action impairing or impeding the Project Work. 
 
Section 1.6 Binding Agreement on Parties and Inclusion of Local Area Residents and 
Businesses:  By executing this Agreement, the City, Council, Unions and Contractors agree to be

2.3.2 Equipment and machinery operated by the City; 
 
Page 170 of 1069
Page 14
City of San Luis Obispo 7 Community Workforce Agreement 
2.3.3 All off-site manufacture and handling of materials, equipment, or machinery; 
provided, however, that lay down or storage areas for equipment or material and manufacturing 
(prefabrication) sites, dedicated solely to the Project or Project Work, and the movement of 
materials or goods between locations on a Project site are within the scope of this Agreement; 
 
2.3.4 All employees of the City, Community Workforce Coordinator, design teams 
(including, but not limited to, architects, engineers and master planners), or any other consultants 
or service providers contracted directly with the City (including, but not limited to, project 
managers and construction managers, Surveyors, Building/Construction Inspectors, and Field 
Soils and Material Testers, and their employees) and their sub-consultants, and other employees 
of professional service organizations who provide services to the City through professional 
services agreements.  However, to the extent that services are performed under a construction 
contract with the Contractor awarded the Project Work or a related construction subcontract, this 
Agreement shall include the classifications of Surveyor, Building/Construction Inspector and 
Field Soils and Material Testers (Inspectors) as a covered craft under this Agreement as applied 
to the scope of work defined in the Master Labor Agreement for said craft and shall also 
specifically include such work where it is referred to by utilization of such terms as “quality 
control” or “quality assurance.” In that circumstance, every Surveyor, Building/Construction 
Inspector performing work under these classifications pursuant to a construction contract with a 
Contractor for Project Work shall be bound to all applicable requirements of this Agreement;  
 
2.3.5 Any work performed on or near or leading to or into a site of work covered by 
this Agreement and undertaken by state, county, city, California Polytechnic University, or other 
governmental bodies, or their Contractors or consultants; or by public utilities, or their 
Contractors or consultants; and/or by the City or its Contractors or consultants (for work that is 
not within the scope of this Agreement); 
 
2.3.6 Off-site maintenance of leased equipment and on-site supervision of such work; 
 
 2.3.7 It is recognized that certain equipment and systems of a highly technical and 
specialized nature will have to be installed at the Project. The nature of the equipment and 
systems, together with requirements of manufacturer’s warranty, may dictate that it be 
prefabricated, pre-piped, and/or pre-wired and that it be installed under the supervision and 
direction of the Owner’s and/or manufacturer’s personnel.  The Unions agree to install such 
material, equipment and systems without incident, or allow such installation to be performed by 
the manufacturer’s employees or a contractor certified by the manufacturer where the Unions are 
unable to perform such work or the warranty requires the work to be performed by the 
employees of the manufacturer or a contractor certified by the manufacturer. If a warranty on the 
manufacturer’s specialty or technical equipment or systems purchased by the Owner requires that 
the installation of such specialty or technical equipment or system be performed by the 
manufacturer’s own personnel, then such installation may be performed by the manufacturer’s 
own personnel. If a warranty on the manufacturer’s specialty or technical equipment or systems 
purchased by the Owner requires that the installation of such specialty or technical equipment or 
system be performed by a contractor certified by the manufacturer, and there are no Union 
signatory contractors certified by the manufacturer to install and/or perform such work, then such 
installation may be performed by such certified contractor. The Contractor shall notify the 
Page 171 of 1069
Page 15
City of San Luis Obispo 8 Community Workforce Agreement 
Unions at the pre-job conference of the use of this provision and shall provide copies of the 
written warranty that require that the work be performed by the manufacturer’s own personnel, 
or a contractor certified by the manufacturer, to the affected Union. When the warranty does not 
require installation by the manufacturer’s own personnel or a contractor certified by the 
manufacturer, the Unions agree to perform and install such work under the supervision and 
direction of the manufacturer’s representative; 
 
2.3.8 Non-construction support services contracted by the City, Community Workforce 
Coordinator, consultants, or Contractor in connection with this Project; 
 
2.3.9  Off-site laboratory work for testing; and 
 
2.3.10 The movement and placement of free-standing furniture owned or controlled by 
the Owner; however, the installation of office furniture that is attached to the realty shall be 
covered by this Agreement. 
 
Section 2.4 After installation by the Contractor(s) and upon notice of completion, it is 
understood the City reserves the right to perform start-up, operation, repair, maintenance or 
revision of equipment or systems with persons of the City’s choice.  If required, the service 
representative may make a final check to protect the terms of a manufacturer’s guarantee or 
warranty prior to start-up of a piece of equipment. 
 
Section 2.5  Awarding of Contracts:  
 
2.5.1 The City and/or the Contractors, as appropriate, have the absolute right to award 
contracts or subcontracts on this Project to any Contractor notwithstanding the existence or non-
existence of any agreements between such Contractor and any Union parties, provided only that 
such Contractor is ready, willing and able to execute and comply with this Community 
Workforce Agreement should such Contractor be awarded work covered by this Agreement.  
 
2.5.2 Subject to section 2.6, below, it is agreed that all Contractors and subcontractors 
of whatever tier, who have been awarded contracts for work covered by this Agreement, shall be 
required to accept and be bound to the terms and conditions of this Community Workforce 
Agreement, and shall evidence their acceptance by the execution of the Letter of Assent set forth 
in Attachment “A” hereto, prior to the commencement of work.  At the time that any Contractor 
enters into a subcontract with any subcontractor of any tier providing for the performance on the 
construction contract, the Contractor shall provide a copy of this Agreement to said 
subcontractor and shall require the subcontractor, as a part of accepting the award of a 
construction subcontract, to agree in writing in the form of a Letter of Assent to be bound by 
each and every provision of this Agreement prior to the commencement of work on the Project. 
No Contractor or subcontractor shall commence Project Work without having first provided a 
copy of the Letter of Assent as executed by it to the Community Workforce Coordinator and to 
the Council forty-eight (48) hours before the commencement of Project Work, or within forty-
eight (48) hours after the award of Project Work to that Contractor (or subcontractor), whichever 
occurs later.

City of San Luis Obispo 9 Community Workforce Agreement 
Section 2.6  Coverage Exception:   This Agreement shall not apply if the City receives funding 
or assistance from any Federal, State, local or other public entity for the Construction Contract if 
a requirement, condition or other term of receiving that funding or assistance, at the time of the 
awarding of the contract, is that the City not require bidders, contractors, subcontractors or other 
persons or entities to enter into an agreement with one or more labor organizations or enter into 
an agreement that contains any of the terms set forth herein.  The City agrees that it will make 
every effort to establish the enforcement of this Agreement with any governmental agency or 
granting authority.  If the City receives funding or assistance from any Federal, State, local or 
other public entity for a Project, after award of such project, and such funding prohibits the use 
of this Agreement, the Parties shall meet and discuss the issue. The City agrees that it will make 
a good faith effort to establish the enforcement of this Agreement with any governmental agency 
or granting authority and the Unions agree to jointly defend and support any defense of a Project 
challenged because of the application of this Agreement to such Project. 
 
Section 2.7  Master Labor Agreements: 
 
2.7.1 The provisions of this Agreement, including the Master Labor Agreements 
(hereinafter “MLAs”), as such may be changed from time-to-time and which are incorporated 
herein by reference, shall apply to the work covered by this Agreement.  This Agreement is not 
intended to supersede the MLAs between any of the Contractors performing construction work 
on the Project and a Union signatory thereto except to the extent the provisions of this 
Agreement are inconsistent with such MLAs, in which event the provisions of this Agreement 
shall apply. However, such does not apply to work performed under the National Cooling Tower 
Agreement, the National Stack Agreement, the National Transit Division Agreement (NTD), 
work within the jurisdiction of the International Union of Elevator Constructors, and all 
instrument calibration and loop checking work performed under the terms of the UA/IBEW Joint 
National Agreement for Instrument and Control Systems Technicians except that Articles 
dealing with Work Stoppages and Lock-Outs, Work Assignments and Jurisdictional Disputes, 
and Settlement of Grievances and Disputes shall apply to such work. Where a subject is covered 
by the provisions of an MLA and not covered by this Agreement, the provisions of the MLA 
shall apply. It is specifically agreed that no later agreement shall be deemed to have precedence 
over this Agreement unless signed by all Parties signatory hereto who are then currently 
employed or represented at the Project.  Any dispute as to the applicable source between this 
Agreement and any MLA for determining the wages, hours or working conditions of employees 
on this Project shall be resolved under the procedures established in Article 9. 
 
2.7.2 It is understood that this Agreement, together with the referenced MLAs, 
constitutes a self-contained, stand-alone agreement and by virtue of having become bound to this 
Community Workforce Agreement, the Contractor will not be obligated to sign any other local, 
area or national collective bargaining agreement as a condition of performing work within the 
scope of this Agreement (provided, however, that the Contractor may be required to sign an 
uniformly applied, non-discriminatory “Subscription Agreement” at the request of the trustees or 
administrator of a trust fund established pursuant to Section 302 of the Labor Management 
Relations Act, and to which such Contractor is bound to make contributions under this 
Agreement, provided that such Subscription Agreement does not purport to bind the Contractor 
beyond the terms and conditions of this Agreement and/or expand its obligation to make 
Page 173 of 1069
Page 17
City of San Luis Obispo 10 Community Workforce Agreement 
contributions pursuant thereto).  It shall be the responsibility of the prime Contractor to have 
each of its subcontractors sign such Subscription Agreement, to the extent required by this 
Agreement, with the appropriate Craft Union prior to the subcontractor beginning Project Work. 
 
Section 2.8  Binding Signatories Only:  This Agreement shall only be binding on the signatory 
Parties hereto, and shall not apply to the parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, or other ventures of any 
such Party. 
 
Section 2.9  Other City Work:  This Agreement shall be limited to the construction work 
within the Scope of this Agreement including, specifically, site preparation and related 
demolition work, and new construction and major rehabilitation work referenced in Section 2.2 
above.  Nothing contained herein shall be interpreted to prohibit, restrict, or interfere with the 
performance of any other operation, work or function not covered by this Agreement, which may 
be performed by City employees or contracted for by the City for its own account, on its property 
or in and around a Project site. 
 
Section 2.10  Separate Liability:  It is understood that the liability of the Contractor(s) and the 
liability of the separate Unions under this Agreement shall be several and not joint.  The Unions 
agree that this Agreement does not have the effect of creating any joint employment status 
between or among the City or Community Workforce Coordinator and/or any Contractor. 
 
Section 2.11  Completed Project Work:   As areas, phases, portions, sections or segments of 
Project Work are accepted by the City, this Agreement shall have no further force or effect on 
such items or areas except where the Contractor is directed by the City or its representatives to 
engage in repairs, modification, check-out and/or warranties functions required by its contract(s) 
with the City.  
 
ARTICLE 3 
UNION RECOGNITION AND EMPLOYMENT 
 
Section 3.1  Recognition:  The Contractor recognizes the Council and the Unions as the 
exclusive bargaining representative for the employees engaged in Project Work.   
 
Section 3.2  Contractor Selection of Employees:  The Contractor shall have the right to 
determine the competency of all employees, the duties of such employees within their craft 
jurisdiction, and shall have the sole responsibility for selecting employees to be laid off. The 
Contractor shall also have the right to reject any applicant referred by a Union for any reason, 
subject to any reporting pay required under the appropriate MLA; provided, however, that such 
right is exercised in good faith and not for the purpose of avoiding the Contractor’s commitment 
to employ qualified workers through the procedures endorsed in this Agreement. 
 
Section 3.3  Referral Procedures: 
 
3.3.1 For signatory Unions now having a job referral system contained in a MLA, the 
Contractor agrees to comply with such system, and it shall be used exclusively by such 
Contractor, except as modified by this Agreement. Such job referral system will be operated in a 
Page 174 of 1069
Page 18
City of San Luis Obispo 11 Community Workforce Agreement 
nondiscriminatory manner and in full compliance with federal, state, and local laws and 
regulations which require equal emplo yment opportunities and non-discrimination. All of the 
foregoing hiring procedures, including related practices affecting apprenticeship, shall be 
operated so as to consider the goals of the City to encourage employment of Local Area 
Residents and participation of Local Area Contractors on the Project, and to facilitate the ability 
of all Contractors to meet their employment needs. 
 
 3.3.2 The Unions will exert their best efforts to recruit and refer sufficient numbers of 
skilled craft workers to fulfill the labor requirements of the Contractor, including specific 
employment obligations to which the Contractor may be legally and/or contractually obligated; 
and to refer apprentices as requested to develop a larger, skilled workforce.  The Unions will 
work with their affiliated regional and national unions, and jointly with the Community 
Workforce Coordinator and others designated by the City, to identify and refer competent craft 
persons as needed for Project Work, and to identify and hire individuals, giving preference to 
Local Area Residents, for entrance into approved apprenticeship programs, or participation in 
other identified programs and procedures to assist individuals in qualifying and becoming 
eligible for such apprenticeship programs, all maintained to increase the available supply of 
skilled craft personnel. 
 
3.3.3 The Union shall not knowingly refer an employee currently employed by a 
Contractor on Project Work to any other Contractor. 
 
 3.3.4 Core Workers:   As the initial workers on the Project, a Local Area Contractor, 
which is not currently working under a Master Labor Agreement, that is awarded work on the 
Project may directly employ up to a maximum of three (3) members of its regular, local, 
experienced work force, where the employees so designated as “Core Workers” meet the 
following qualifications: 
 
(a) Possess any license required by state or Federal law for the Project work to be 
performed; 
  
(b) Have worked at least two thousand (2,000) hours in the applicable trade or

the one hundred (100) working days immediately preceding the award of the 
Project Work to the Contractor;  
 
(d) Are Local Area Residents;  
 
(e) Have the ability to safely perform the basic functions of the applicable craft or 
trade. 
 
After directly employing up to three (3) Core Workers, the Local Area Contractor shall thereafter

Page 175 of 1069
Page 19
City of San Luis Obispo 12 Community Workforce Agreement 
Contractor, upon request by the Community Workforce Coordinator, shall provide the necessary 
documentation to support the qualification of an employee as a Core Worker. 
 
If additional workers are needed following the hiring of workers pursuant to the provisions 
above, then the Local Area Contractor shall request, and the Union shall refer a worker from its 
referral list.  Local Area Contractors may then directly employ one (1) additional of their 
qualified Core Workers that is referred pursuant to the referral procedures referenced in this 
Section 3, after which one (1) worker shall be referred from the Union referral list. This 
alternating procedure of referral shall continue until a maximum of eight (8) qualified Core 
Workers have been directly employed by or referred to the Contractor.  All additional workers 
shall be requested and referred pursuant to otherwise applicable Union referral list procedures 
and the local hire provisions of this Agreement.  On layoffs, the Contractor shall reverse the 
alternating process.  The Contractor shall notify the appropriate Union utilizing the Craft Request 
Form (Attachment “C”) and each of the additional workers utilized under the procedures in this 
paragraph shall register with the Union’s hiring hall before commencing work on the Project.  If 
there is any question regarding a worker’s eligibility under this Section 3.3.4, the Contractor 
shall provide satisfactory proof of such at a Union’s request.  The provisions of this Section 3.3.4 
shall only appl y to Local Area Contractors and workers who are not working under the terms of 
a Master Labor Agreement at the time of their transfer to work covered under this Agreement. 
 
 All other Contractors not currently signatory to a Master Labor Agreement that is awarded work 
on the Project may directly employ one (1) Core Worker (as defined below) that is referred 
pursuant to the referral procedures referenced in this Section 3 after which one (1) worker shall 
be referred from the Union referral list.  This alternating procedure of referral shall continue until 
a maximum of five (5) qualified Core Workers have been directly employed by or referred to the 
Contractor.  All additional workers shall be requested and referred pursuant to otherwise 
applicable Union referral list procedures and the local hire provisions of this Agreement.  On 
layoffs, the Contractor shall reverse the alternating process.  The Contractor shall notify the 
appropriate Union utilizing the Craft Request Form (Attachment “C”) and each of the 
additional workers utilized under the procedures in this paragraph shall register with the Union’s 
hiring hall before commencing work on the Project.  If there is any question regarding a worker’s 
eligibility under this section 3.3.4, the Contractor shall provide satisfactory proof of such at a 
Union’s request.  “Core Workers” are those employees who meet the following qualifications: 
 
(a) Possesses any license required by state or Federal law for the Project work to be 
performed; 
 
(b) Have worked at least two thousand (2,000) hours in the applicable trade or craft;

the Contractor; and 
 
(d) Have the ability to safely perform the basic functions of the applicable craft or trade. 
 
The Core Workers shall present to and be dispatched through the applicable Union referral 
procedures.   
Page 176 of 1069
Page 20
City of San Luis Obispo 13 Community Workforce Agreement 
 
   3.3.4.1 Prior to each Contractor performing any work on the Project, each 
Contractor shall provide a list of its Core Workers to the Community Workforce Coordinator and 
the Council.  Failure to do so will prohibit the Contractor from using any Core Workers. Upon 
request by any Party to this Agreement, the Contractor hiring any Core Worker shall provide 
satisfactory proof (e.g., payroll records, quarterly tax records, driver’s license, voter registration, 
postal address and such other documentation) evidencing the Core Worker’s qualification as a 
core employee to the Community Workforce Coordinator and the Council.  
 
Section 3.4  Non-Discrimination in Referral, Employment, and Contracting:  The Unions and 
Contractors agree that they will not discriminate against any employee or applicant for 
employment in hiring and dispatching on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, gender, national 
origin, age, membership in a labor organization, sexual orientation, political affiliation, marital 
status, or disability.  The Parties shall jointly endeavor to assure that these commitments are fully 
met, and that any provisions of this Agreement which may appear to interfere within a local and 
small business enterprises successfully bidding for work within the scope of this Agreement shall 
be carefully reviewed, and adjustments made as may be appropriate and agreed upon among the 
Parties, to ensure full compliance with the spirit and letter of the City’s policies and commitment 
to its goals for the significant utilization of local and small businesses as direct Contractors or 
suppliers for Project Work. 
 
Section 3.5  Employment of Local Area Residents:  
 
 3.5.1 The Unions and Contractors agree that, to the maximum extent allowed by law, 
and as long as they possess the requisite skills and qualifications, the Unions will exert their best 
efforts to recruit sufficient numbers of skilled craft Local Area Residents as defined herein, to 
fulfill the requirements of the Contractors and shall refer on a priority basis all available, 
qualified Local Area Resident workers. In recognition of the fact that the City and the 
communities surrounding Project Work will be impacted by the construction of the Project, the 
Parties agree to support the hiring of Local Area Resident workers, as well as Veterans. Towards 
that end, the Unions agree that they will exert their best efforts to encourage and provide 
referrals and utilization of qualified workers in accordance with the following priority: 
 
 3.5.1.1 First, Local Area Residents residing in those first-tier zip codes which 
cover the City of San Luis Obispo (Tier 1), as reflected on the attached list of zip codes as 
reflected on Attachment “B”.   
 
 3.5.1.2 If the Unions cannot provide the Contractors with a sufficient number of 
qualified workers from Paragraph 3.5.1.1, above, the Unions will exert their best efforts to then 
recruit qualified workers residing within the County of San Luis Obispo (Tier 2), and shall refer 
all such available workers, giving first priority to Veterans residing in county.  
 
 3.5.1.3 If the Unions still have not provided the Contractors with a sufficient 
number of qualified workers from Paragraphs 3.5.1.1 and 3.5.1.2, above, the Unions will then 
exert their best efforts to recruit qualified workers residing in the zip codes specified within 
Page 177 of 1069
Page 21
City of San Luis Obispo 14 Community Workforce Agreement 
Santa Barbara and Monterey counties (Tier 3), and shall refer all such available workers, giving 
first priority to Veterans residing in those zip codes.  
 
  3.5.1.4 If the Unions still have not provided the Contractors with a sufficient 
number of qualified workers from Paragraphs 3.6.1.1, 3.6.1.2, and 3.6.1.3 above, the Unions will 
then exert their best efforts to recruit qualified workers residing in the zip codes specified within 
Ventura County (Tier 4), and shall refer all such available workers, giving first priority to 
Veterans residing in those zip codes. 
 
 3.5.2 A goal of at least 50% of all of the construction labor hours worked on the Project 
shall be from Local Area Residents, with first priority referrals on all Contractor requests given 
to available Local Area Residents, in ascending order of tier, regardless of attainment of goals. 
To facilitate the dispatch of Local Area Residents, all Contractors will be required to utilize the 
Craft Employee Request Form whenever they are requesting the referral of any employee from a 
Union referral list for any Project Work, a sample of which is attached as Attachment “C”.  
Should the referral data show that the participation goal is not being met, the Parties agree to 
meet and confer regarding changes, including, but not limited to, increasing the number of Core 
Workers that are Local Area Residents, that can be immediately implemented in order to achieve 
the participation goal. 
 
3.5.3 The Community Workforce Coordinator shall work with the Unions and 
Contractors in the administration of this Local Area Resident preference; and the Contractors and 
Unions shall cooperate by maintaining adequate records to demonstrate to the Community 
Workforce Coordinator that such preferences have been pursued.  
 
 3.5.4 In determining compliance with the targeted hiring goals of Section 3.5.2 
above, hours of Project Work performed by residents of states other than California will be 
excluded from the calculation. Additionally, the Local Area residency requirement, set 
forth in Section 3.3.4(d), shall not apply to out of state workers. 
 
Section 3.6 Helmets to Hardhats: The Contractors and the Unions recognize a desire to 
facilitate the entry into the building and construction trades of veterans who are interested in 
careers in the building and construction industry.  The Contractors and Unions agree to utilize the 
services of the Center for Military Recruitment, Assessment and Veterans Employment 
(hereinafter “Center”) and the Center’s “Helmets to Hardhats” program to serve as a resource for 
preliminary orientation, assessment of construction aptitude, referral to apprenticeship programs 
or hiring halls, counseling and mentoring, support network, employment opportunities and other 
needs as identified by the Parties.  For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Eligible Veteran” 
shall have the same meaning as the term “veteran” as defined under Title 5, Section 2108(1) of the 
United States Code as the same may be amended or re-codified from time to time.  It shall be the 
responsibility of each qualified Local Area Resident to provide the Unions with proof of his/her 
status as an Eligible Veteran.   
    
The Unions and Contractors agree to coordinate with the Center to create and maintain an 
integrated database of veterans interested in working on this Project and of apprenticeship and 
Page 178 of 1069
Page 22
City of San Luis Obispo 15 Community Workforce Agreement 
employment opportunities for this Project.  To the extent permitted by law, the Unions will give 
credit to such veterans for bona fide, provable past experience.  
 
Section 3.7  Time for Referral:  If any Union’s registration and referral system does not fulfill 
the requirements for specific classifications requested by any Contractor within forty-eight (48) 
hours (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays), that Contractor may use employment 
sources other than the Union registration and referral services and may employ applicants 
meeting such standards from any other available source. The Contractors shall inform the Union 
of any applicants hired from other sources within forty-eight (48) hours of such applicant being 
hired, and such applicants shall register with the appropriate hiring hall, if any, prior to 
commencing work on the Project. 
 
Section 3.8  Lack of Referral Procedure:  If a signatory Union does not have a job referral 
system as set forth in Section 3.3 above, the Contractors shall give the Union equal opportunity 
to refer applicants. The Contractors shall notify the Union of employees so hired, as set forth in 
Section 3.5. 
 
Section 3.9  Union Membership:  Employees are not required to become or remain union 
members or pay dues or fees as a condition of performing covered work under this 
Agreement.  Contractors shall make and transmit all deductions for union dues, fees, and 
assessments that have been authorized by employees in writing in accordance with the applicable 
Master Agreement. Nothing in this Section 3.9 is intended to supersede the requirements of 
applicable Master Agreements as to those Contractors otherwise signatory to such Master 
Agreements and as to the employees of those Contractors who are performing covered work. 
 
Section 3.10  Individual Seniority:  Except as provided in Section 4.3, individual seniority shall 
not be recognized or applied to employees working on the Project; provided, however, that group 
and/or classification seniority in a Union’s MLA, as of the effective date of this Agreement shall 
he recognized for purposes of layoffs. 
 
Section 3.11  Foremen:  The selection and number of craft foreman and/or general foreman 
shall be the responsibility of the Contractor. All foremen shall take orders exclusively from the 
designated Contractor representatives.  Craft foreman shall be designated as working foreman at 
the request of the Contractors. 
 
ARTICLE 4 
UNION ACCESS AND STEWARDS 
 
Section 4.1  Access to Project Sites:  Authorized representatives of the Union shall have 
access to Project Work, provided that they do not interfere with the work of employees and 
further provided that such representatives fully comply with posted visitor, security, and safety 
rules.

4.2.1 Each signatory Union shall have the right to dispatch a working journeyperson as 
a steward for each shift and shall notify the Contractor in writing of the identity of the designated 
steward or stewards prior to the assumption of such person’s duties as steward.  Such designated 
steward or stewards shall not exercise any supervisory functions. There will be no non-working 
stewards. Stewards will receive the regular rate of pay for their respective crafts. 
 
4.2.2 In addition to his/her work as an employee, the steward should have the right to 
receive, but not to solicit, complaints or grievances and to discuss and assist in the adjustment of 
the same with the employee’s appropriate supervisor.  Each steward should be concerned only 
with the employees of the steward’s Contractor and, if applicable, subcontractor(s), and not with 
the employees of any other Contractor. A Contractor will not discriminate against the steward on 
the basis of proper performance of his/her Union duties. 
 
4.2.3 When a Contractor has multiple, non-contiguous work locations at one site, the 
Contractor may request, and the Union shall appoint such additional working stewards as the 
Contractor requests to provide independent coverage of one or more such locations. In such 
cases, a steward may not service more than one work location without the approval of the 
Contractor. 
 
4.2.4 The stewards shall not have the right to determine when overtime shall be worked 
or who shall work overtime. 
 
Section 4.3  Steward Layoff/Discharge:  The relevant Contractor agrees to notify the 
appropriate Union twenty-four (24) hours before the layoff of a steward, except in the case of 
disciplinary discharge for just cause.  If the steward is protected against such layoff by the 
provisions of the applicable MLA, such provisions shall be recognized when the steward 
possesses the necessary qualifications to perform the remaining work.  In any case in which the 
steward is discharged or disciplined for just cause, the appropriate Union will be notified 
immediately by the Contractor, and such discharge or discipline shall not become final (subject 
to any later filed grievance) until twenty-four (24) hours after such notice has been given. 
 
Section 4.4  Employees on Non-Project Work:  On work where the personnel of the City may 
be working in close proximity to the construction activities covered by this Agreement, the 
Union agrees that the Union representatives, stewards, and individual workers will not interfere 
with the City personnel, or with personnel employed by the any other employer not a Party to 
this Agreement. 
 
ARTICLE 5 
WAGES AND BENEFITS 
 
Section 5.1  Wages:    All employees covered by this Agreement shall be classified in 
accordance with work performed and paid by the Contractors the hourly wage rates for those 
classifications in compliance with the applicable prevailing wage rate determination established 
pursuant to applicable law. If a prevailing rate increases under law, the Contractor shall pay that 
rate as of its effective date under the law. Notwithstanding any other provision of this 
Page 180 of 1069
Page 24
City of San Luis Obispo 17 Community Workforce Agreement 
Agreement, this Agreement does not relieve Contractors directly signatory to one or more of the 
Master Labor Agreements from paying all wages set forth in such Agreements.  
 
Section 5.2  Benefits:  
 
5.2.1 Contractors shall pay contributions to the established employee benefit funds in 
the amounts designated in the appropriate MLA and make all employee authorized deductions in 
the amounts designated in the appropriate MLA; provided, however, that such contributions shall 
not exceed the contribution amounts set forth in the applicable prevailing wage determination. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Contractors directly signatory to one or 
more of the Master Labor Agreements are required to make all contributions set forth in those 
Master Labor Agreements without reference to the forgoing.  Bona fide benefit plans with joint 
trustees or authorized employee deduction programs established or negotiated under the 
applicable MLA, or by the Parties to this Agreement during the life of this Agreement may be 
added.  
 
5.2.2 The Contractor adopts and agrees to be bound by the written terms of the 
applicable, legally established, trust agreement(s) specifying the detailed basis on which 
payments are to be made into, and benefits paid out of, such trust funds for its employees.  The 
Contractor authorizes the parties to such trust funds to appoint trustees and successor trustees to 
administer the trust funds and hereby ratifies and accepts the trustees so appointed as if made by 
the Contractor. 
 
5.2.3 Each Contractor and subcontractor is required to certify to the Community 
Workforce Coordinator that it has paid all benefit contributions due and owing to the appropriate 
Trust(s) prior to the receipt of its final payment and/or retention.  Further, upon timely 
notification by a Union to the Community Workforce Coordinator, the Community Workforce 
Coordinator shall work with any prime Contractor or subcontractor who is delinquent in 
payments to assure that proper benefit contributions are made, to the extent of requesting the 
City or the prime Contractor to withhold payments otherwise due such Contractor, until such 
contributions have been made or otherwise guaranteed. 
 
Section 5.3  Wage Premiums:  Wage premiums, including but not limited to pay based on 
height of work, hazard pay, scaffold pay, and special skills shall not be applicable to work under 
this Agreement, except to the extent provided for in any applicable prevailing wage 
determination. 
 
Section 5.4  Compliance with Prevailing Wage Laws:  The Parties agree that the Community 
Workforce Coordinator shall monitor the compliance by all Contractors and subcontractors with 
all applicable federal and state prevailing wage laws and regulations, and that such monitoring 
shall include Contractors engaged in what would otherwise be Project Work but for the 
exceptions to Agreement coverage in Section 2.2.  All complaints regarding possible prevailing 
wage violations shall be referred to the Community Workforce Coordinator for processing, 
investigation, and resolution, and if not resolved within thirty (30) calendar days, may be 
referred by any party to the state labor commissioner.

ARTICLE 6 
WORK STOPPAGES AND LOCK-OUTS 
 
Section 6.1  No Work Stoppages or Disruptive Activity:  The Council and the Unions agree 
that neither they, and each of them, nor their respective officers or agents or representatives, shall 
incite or encourage, condone or participate in any strike, walk-out, slow-down, picketing, 
observing picket lines or other activity of any nature or kind whatsoever, for any cause or dispute 
whatsoever with respect to or in any way related to Project Work, or which interferes with or 
otherwise disrupts Project Work, or with respect to or related to the City or Contractors or 
subcontractors, including, but not limited to economic strikes, unfair labor practice strikes, safety 
strikes, sympathy strikes and jurisdictional strikes whether or not the underlying dispute is 
subject to arbitration.  Any such actions by the Council, or Unions, or their members, agents, 
representatives or the employees they represent shall constitute a violation of this Agreement.  
The Council and the Union shall take all steps necessary to obtain compliance with this Article 
and neither should be held liable for conduct for which it is not responsible. 
 
Section 6.2  Employee Violations:  The Contractor may discharge any employee violating 
Section 6.1 above and any such employee will not be eligible for rehire under this Agreement. 
 
Section 6.3  Standing to Enforce:  The City, the Community Workforce Coordinator, or any 
Contractor affected by an alleged violation of Section 6.1 shall have standing and the right to 
enforce the obligations established therein. 
 
Section 6.4  Expiration of MLAs:  If the MLA, or any local, regional, and other applicable 
collective bargaining agreements expire during the term of the Project, the Union(s) agree that 
there shall be no work disruption of any kind as described in Section 6.1 above as a result of the 
expiration of any such agreement(s) having application on this Project and/or failure of the 
involved Parties to that agreement to reach a new contract.  Terms and conditions of employment 
established and set at the time of bid shall remain established and set. Otherwise to the extent 
that such agreement does expire and the parties to that agreement have failed to reach 
concurrence on a new contract, work will continue on the Project on one of the following two (2) 
options, both of which will be offered by the Unions involved to the Contractors affected: 
 
6.4.1  Each of the Unions with a contract expiring must offer to continue working on the 
Project under interim agreements that retain all the terms of the expiring contract, except that the 
Unions involved in such expiring contract may each propose wage rates and employer 
contribution rates to employee benefit funds under the prior contract different from what those 
wage rates and employer contributions rates were under the expiring contracts.  The terms of the 
Union’s interim agreement offered to Contractors will be no less favorable than the terms offered 
by the Union to any other employer or group of employers covering the same type of 
construction work in San Luis Obispo County. 
 
6.4.2  Each of the Unions with a contract expiring must offer to continue working on the 
Project under all the terms of the expiring contract, including the wage rates and employer 
contribution rates to the employee benefit funds, if the Contractor affected by that expiring 
contract agrees to the following retroactive provisions:  if a new MLA, local, regional or other 
Page 182 of 1069
Page 26
City of San Luis Obispo 19 Community Workforce Agreement 
applicable labor agreement for the industry having application at the Project is ratified and 
signed during the term of this Agreement and if such new labor agreement provides for 
retroactive wage increases, then each affected Contractor shall pay to its employees who 
performed work covered by this Agreement at the Project during the hiatus between the effective 
dates of such expired and new labor agreements, an amount equal to any such retroactive wage 
increase established by such new labor agreement, retroactive to whatever date is provided by 
the new labor agreement for such increase to go into effect, for each employee’s hours worked 
on the Project during the retroactive period.  All Parties agree that such affected Contractors shall 
be solely responsible for any retroactive payment to its employees.   
 
6.4.3  Some Contractors may elect to continue to work on the Project under the terms of 
the interim agreement option offered under Paragraph 6.4.1, above and other Contractors may 
elect to continue to work on the Project under the retroactivity option offered under paragraph 
6.4.2, above.  To decide between the two options, Contractors will be given one week after the 
particular labor agreement has expired or one week after the Union has personally delivered to 
the Contractors in writing its specific offer of terms of the interim agreement pursuant to 
Paragraph (a) above, whichever is the later date.  If the Contractor fails to timely select one of 
the two options, the Contractor shall be deemed to have selected the retroactivity option offered 
under Paragraph 6.4.2, above.   
 
Section 6.5  No Lockouts:  Contractors shall not cause, incite, encourage, condone or 
participate in any lock-out of employees with respect to Project Work during the term of this 
Agreement.  The term “lock-out” refers only to a Contractor’s exclusion of employees in order to 
secure collective bargaining advantage, and does not refer to the discharge, termination or layoff 
of employees by the Contractor for any reason in the exercise of rights pursuant to any provision 
of this Agreement, or any other agreement, nor does “lock-out” include the City’s decision to 
stop, suspend or discontinue any Project Work or any portion thereof for any reason. 
 
Section 6.6  Best Efforts to End Violations: 
 
6.6.1 If a Contractor contends that there is any violation of this Article or Section 7.3, it 
shall notify, in writing, the Executive Secretary of the Council, the Senior Executive of the 
involved Union(s) and the Community Workforce Coordinator.  The Executive Secretary and the 
leadership of the involved Union(s) will immediately instruct, order and use their best efforts to 
cause the cessation of any violation of the relevant Article. 
 
6.6.2 If the Union contends that any Contractor has violated this Article, it will notify 
the Contractor and the Community Workforce Coordinator, setting forth the facts which the 
Union contends violate the Agreement, at least twenty-four (24) hours prior to invoking the 
procedures of Section 6.8.  The Community Workforce Coordinator shall promptly order the 
involved Contractor(s) to cease any violation of the Article. 
 
Section 6.7 Withholding of services for failure to pay wages and fringe benefits:    
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, it shall not be a violation of 
this Agreement for any Union to withhold the services of its members (but not the right to 
picket) from a particular Contractor who fails to timely pay its weekly payroll; or fails to make 
Page 183 of 1069
Page 27
City of San Luis Obispo 20 Community Workforce Agreement 
timely payments to the Union’s Joint Labor/Management Trust Funds in accordance with the 
provisions of the applicable MLA. Prior to withholding its members’ services for the 
Contractor’s failure to make timely payments to the Union’s Joint Labor/Management Trust 
Funds, the Union shall give at least ten (10) days (unless a lesser period of time is provided in the 
Union’s MLA, but in no event less than seventy-two (72) hours) written notice of such failure to 
pay by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, and by facsimile transmission to the 
involved Contractor and the City.  Union will meet within the ten (10) day period to attempt to 
resolve the dispute. 
 
6.7.1  Upon the payment of the delinquent Contractor of all monies due and then owing 
for wages and/or fringe benefit contributions, the Union shall direct its members to return to 
work and the Contractor shall return all such members back to work. 
 
Section 6.8  Expedited Enforcement Procedure:  Any Party, including the City, which is an 
intended beneficiary of this Article, or the Community Workforce Coordinator, may institute the 
following procedures, in lieu of or in addition to any other action at law or equity, when a breach 
of Section 6.1, 6.5 or Section 7.3 is alleged. 
 
 6.8.1  The Party invoking this procedure shall notify Lou Zigman, or, if Mr. Zigman is 
unavailable, Sara Adler, who have been selected by the negotiating Parties, and whom the Parties 
agree shall be the permanent arbitrator and alternate arbitrator under this procedure.  If the 
permanent arbitrator is unavailable at any time, the party invoking this procedure shall notify 
Sara Adler.  Notice to the arbitrator shall be by the most expeditious means available, with 
notices to the Parties alleged to be in violation, and to the Council if it is a Union alleged to be in 
violation.  For purposes of this Article, written notice may be given by telegram, facsimile, hand- 
delivery or overnight mail and will be deemed effective upon receipt. 
 
 6.8.2  Upon receipt of said notice, the arbitrator named above, or his/her alternate shall 
sit and hold a hearing within twenty-four (24) hours if it is contended that the violation still 
exists, but not sooner than twenty-four (24) hours after notice has been dispatched to the Council 
of the involved Union(s) and/or Contractor. 
 
 6.8.3  The arbitrator shall notify the Parties of the place and time chosen for this 
hearing.  Said hearing shall be completed in one session, which, with appropriate recesses at the 
arbitrator's discretion, shall not exceed twenty-four (24) hours unless otherwise agreed upon by 
all Parties.  A failure of any Party or Parties to attend said hearings shall not delay the hearing of 
evidence or the issuance of any award b y the arbitrator. 
 
 6.8.4  The sole issue at the hearing shall be whether or not a violation of Sections 6.1, 
6.5 or Section 7.3 has in fact occurred.  The arbitrator shall have no authority to consider any 
matter in justification, explanation or mitigation of such violation or to award damages.  The 
Award shall be issued in writing within three (3) hours after the close of the hearing and may be 
issued without an opinion.  If any Party desires a written opinion, one shall be issued within 
fifteen (15) days, but its issuance shall not delay compliance with, or enforcement of, the Award. 
The arbitrator may order cessation of the violation of the Article and other appropriate relief, and 
such Award, upon issuance, shall be served on all Parties by hand or registered mail. 
Page 184 of 1069
Page 28
City of San Luis Obispo 21 Community Workforce Agreement 
 6.8.5  Such Award shall be final and binding on all Parties and may be enforced by any 
court of competent jurisdiction upon the filing of this Agreement and all other relevant 
documents referred to herein above in the following manner.  Written notice of the filing of such 
enforcement proceedings shall be given to the other Party.  In any judicial proceeding to obtain a 
temporary order enforcing the arbitrator's Award as issued under this Article, all Parties waive 
the right to a hearing and agree that such proceedings may be ex parte. Such agreement does not 
waive any Party's right to participate in a hearing for a final order of enforcement.  The court's 
order or orders enforcing the arbitrator's award shall be served on all Parties by hand or by 
delivery to their address as shown on this Agreement (for a Union), as shown in their business 
contract for work under this Agreement (for a Contractor) and to the representing Union (for an 
employee), by certified mail by the Party or Parties first alleging the violation. 
 
 6.8.6  Any rights created by statute or law governing arbitration proceedings 
inconsistent with the above procedure or which interfere with compliance hereto are hereby 
waived by the Parties to whom they accrue. 
 
 6.8.7  The fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall be equally divided between the Party 
or Parties initiating this procedure and the respondent Party or Parties. 
 
6.8.8 Liquidated Damages.    If the arbitrator determines that a work stoppage, in 
violation of Section 6.1 has occurred, the respondent Unions(s) shall, within eight (8) hours of 
receipt of the award, direct all the employees they represent on the project to immediately return 
to work.  If the craft(s) involved does not return to work by the beginning of the next regularly 
scheduled shift following such eight (8) hour period after receipt of the arbitrator’s award, and the 
respondent Union(s) have not complied with their obligation to immediately instruct, order, and 
use their best efforts to cause a cessation of the violation and return of the employees they represent 
to work, then the respondent Union(s) shall each pay a sum as liquidated damages to the City, and 
each shall pay an additional sum per shift for each shift thereafter on which the craft(s) has  not 
returned to work. Similarly, if the arbitrator determines that a lock-out, in violation of Section 6.5 
has occurred, the respondent Contractor(s) shall, within eight (8) hours of receipt of the award, 
return all the affected employees to work on the Project, or otherwise correct the violation as found 
by the arbitrator.  If the respondent Contractor(s) do not take such action by the beginning of the 
next regularly scheduled shift following the eight (8) hour period, each respondent Contractor shall 
pay a sum as liquidated damages in equal amounts to the City and to the affected Union(s) (with 
union amounts to be apportioned among the affected employees and the benefit funds to which 
contributions are made on their behalf, as appropriate and designated b y the Arbitrator) and each 
shall pay an additional sum per shift  for each shift thereafter in which compliance  by the 
respondent Contractor(s) has not been completed.  The Arbitrator shall retain jurisdiction to 
determine compliance with this Section and to establish the appropriate sum of liquidated 
damages, which shall not be less than five thousand dollars ($5,000) per shift, nor more than twenty 
thousand dollars ($20,000) per shift.

violating this section shall be subject to immediate discharge. 
 
Section 7.4  Pre-Job Conferences:   As provided in Article 14, each Contractor will conduct a

Section 7.5  Resolution of Jurisdictional Disputes:  If any actual or threatened strike, sympathy 
strike, work stoppage, slow down, picketing, hand-billing or otherwise advising the public that a

scheduling plans, the City will provide the Community Workforce Coordinator, and the affected 
Contractor(s) and Union(s) with reasonable notice of any changes it requires pursuant to this

Page 31
City of San Luis Obispo 24 Community Workforce Agreement 
8.2.4 Approve any work methods, procedures and techniques used by Contractors 
whether or not these methods, procedures or techniques are part of industry practices or customs,

and utilization, of equipment, machinery, packaging, precast, prefabricated, prefinished, or 
preassembled materials, tools or other labor saving devices, subject to the application of the State 
Public Contract and Labor Codes as required by law in reference to offsite construction. 
Generally, the onsite installation or application of such items shall be performed by the craft

with any standardized and/or catalogue: parts, assemblies, accessories, prefabricated items, 
preassembled items, partially assembled items, or materials whatever their source of manufacture 
or construction. 
 
8.4.2 If any disagreement between the Contractor and the Unions concerning the 
methods of implementation or installation of any equipment, or device or item, or method of 
work, arises, or whether a particular part or pre-assembled item is a standardized or catalog part 
or item, the work will precede as directed by the Contractor and the Parties shall immediately 
consult over the matter.  If the disagreement is not resolved, the affected Union(s) shall have the 
right to proceed through the procedures set forth in Article 9. 
 
ARTICLE 9 
SETTLEMENT OF GRIEVANCES AND DISPUTES 
 
Section 9.1  Cooperation and Harmony on Site: 
 
9.1.1 This Agreement is intended to establish and foster continued close cooperation 
between management and labor.  The Council shall assign a representative to this Project for the

together with the Contractors, to complete the construction of the Project economically, 
efficiently, continuously and without any interruption, delays or work stoppages. 
 
Page 188 of 1069
Page 32
City of San Luis Obispo 25 Community Workforce Agreement 
9.1.2 The Community Workforce Coordinator, the Contractors, Unions, and employees 
collectively and individually, realize the importance to all Parties of maintaining continuous and 
uninterrupted performance Project Work, and agree to resolve disputes in accordance with the 
grievance provisions set forth in this Article or, as appropriate, those of Article 6 or 7. 
 
9.1.3 The Community Workforce Coordinator shall oversee the processing of 
grievances under this Article and Article 6, including the scheduling and arrangements of 
facilities for meetings, selection of the arbitrator from the agreed-upon panel to hear the case, 
and any other administrative matters necessary to facilitate the timely resolution of any dispute; 
provided, however, it is the responsibility of the principal parties to any pending grievance to 
insure the time limits and deadlines are met. 
 
Section 9.2  Processing Grievances:  Any questions arising out of and during the term of this 
Agreement involving its interpretation and application, which includes applicable provisions of 
the MLAs, but not jurisdictional disputes or alleged violations of Section 6.1 and 6.5 and similar 
provisions, shall be considered a grievance and subject to resolution under the following 
procedures. 
 
Step 1.  Employee Grievances:   When any employee subject to the provisions of 
this Agreement feels aggrieved by an alleged violation of this Agreement, the employee shall, 
through his Union business representative or job steward, within ten (10) working days after the 
occurrence of the violation, give notice to the work site representative of the involved Contractor 
stating the provision(s) alleged to have been violated. A business representative of the Union or 
the job steward and the work site representative of the involved Contractor shall meet and 
endeavor to adjust the matter within ten (10) working days after timely notice has been given.  If 
they fail to resolve the matter within the prescribed period, the grieving party may, within ten 
(10) working days thereafter, pursue Step 2 of this grievance procedure provided the grievance is 
reduced to writing, setting forth the relevant information, including a short description thereof, 
the date on which the alleged violation occurred, and the provision(s) of the Agreement alleged 
to have been violated.  Grievances and disputes settled at Step 1 shall be non-precedential except 
as to the parties directly involved. 
 
Union or Contractor Grievances:  Should the Union(s) or any Contractor have 
a dispute with the other party(ies) and, if after conferring within ten (10) working days after the 
disputing party knew or should have known of the facts or occurrence giving rise to the dispute, 
a settlement is not reached within five (5) working days, the dispute shall be reduced to writing 
and processed to Step 2 in the same manner as outlined in 1(a) above for the adjustment of an 
employee complaint. 
 
Step 2.  The business manager of the involved Union or his designee, together with 
the site representative of the involved Contractor, and the labor relations representative of the 
Community Workforce Coordinator, shall meet within seven (7) working days of the referral of 
the dispute to this second step to arrive at a satisfactory settlement thereof.  If the Parties fail to 
reach an agreement, the dispute may be appealed in writing in accordance with the provisions of 
Step 3 within seven (7) calendar days after the initial meeting at Step 2. 
 
Page 189 of 1069
Page 33
City of San Luis Obispo 26 Community Workforce Agreement

ARTICLE 13 
APPRENTICES 
 
Section 13.1  Importance of Training:  The Parties recognize the need to maintain continuing 
support of the programs designed to develop adequate numbers of competent workers in the 
construction industry, the obligation to capitalize on the availability of the local work force in the 
area served by the City, and the opportunities to provide continuing work under the construction 
program.  To these ends, the Parties will facilitate, encourage, and assist Local Area Residents to 
commence and progress in an Approved Apprenticeship Programs and/or training programs in 
the construction industry leading to participation in such apprenticeship programs. The City, the 
Community Workforce Coordinator, and the Council, will work cooperatively to identify, or 
establish and maintain, effective programs and procedures for persons interested in entering the 
construction industry and which will help prepare them for the formal joint labor/management 
apprenticeship programs maintained by the signatory Unions. 
 
   13.1.1 All Apprentices performing work on the project must be registered 
apprentices training under apprenticeship standards that include the specific work processes 
that will be performed by the contractor’s journeymen and shall only be assigned work that is 
included in the apprenticeship standards under which they are indentured.  
 
Section 13.2  Use of Apprentices: 
 
13.2.1 Apprentices used on Projects under this Agreement shall be registered in 
Approved Apprenticeship Programs approved by the State of California and the Federal 
Department of Labor, to the extent required by any Project funding source.  Apprentices may 
comprise up to thirty percent (30%) of each craft’s work force at any time, unless the standards 
Page 192 of 1069
Page 36
City of San Luis Obispo 29 Community Workforce Agreement 
of the applicable joint apprenticeship committee confirmed by the Division of Apprenticeship 
Standards (“DAS”), establish a lower or higher maximum percentage, and where such is the 
case, the applicable Union should use its best efforts with its apprenticeship committee and, if 
necessary, the DAS to permit up to thirty percent (30%) apprentices on the Project.  
 
13.2.2 The Unions agree to cooperate with the Contractor in furnishing apprentices as 
requested up to the maximum percentage.  The apprentice ratio for each craft shall be in 
compliance, at a minimum, with the applicable provisions of the Labor Code relating to 
utilization of apprentices.  The City shall encourage such utilization, and, both as to apprentices 
and the overall supply of experienced workers, the Community Workforce Coordinator will 
work with the Council to assure appropriate and maximum utilization of apprentices and the 
continuing availability of both apprentices and journey persons. 
 
13.2.3 The Parties agree that apprentices will not be dispatched to Contractors working 
under this Agreement unless there is a journeyman working on the project where the apprentice 
is to be employed who is qualified to assist and oversee the apprentice’s progress through the 
program in which he is participating. 
 
13.2.4 All apprentices shall work under the direct supervision of a journeyman from the 
trade in which the apprentice is indentured.  A journeyman shall be defined as set forth in the 
California Code of Regulations, Title 8 [apprenticeship], Section 205, which defines a 
journeyman as a person who has either completed an accredited apprenticeship in his or her craft 
or has completed the equivalent of an apprenticeship in length and content of work experience 
and all other requirements in the craft which has workers classified as journeyman in the 
apprenticeship occupation.  Should a question arise as to a journeyman’s qualification under this 
subsection, the Contractor shall provide adequate proof evidencing the worker’s qualification as 
a journeyman to the Community Workforce Coordinator and the Council. 
 
ARTICLE 14 
PRE-JOB CONFERENCES 
 
Each prime Contractor will conduct a pre-job conference with the Unions for it and all of its 
subcontractors not later than fourteen (14) calendar days prior to commencing work for each stage 
of the Project. Each Contractor conducting a pre-job shall notify the Council and all subcontractors 
of all tiers, who shall participate in such conferences, seven (7) days in advance of all such 
conferences. The purpose of the conference will be to, among other things, determine craft 
manpower needs, schedule of work for the contract and project work rules/owner rules. The 
Council, the Community Workforce Coordinator, and the City shall be advised in advance of all 
such conferences and may participate if they wish.  All work assignments shall be disclosed by the 
prime Contractor and all Contractors at the pre-job conference. Should there be Project Work that 
was not previously discussed at the pre-job conference, or additional project work be added, the 
contractors performing such work will conduct a separate pre-job conference for such newly 
included work. Any Union in disagreement with the proposed assignment shall notify the 
Contractor of its position in writing, with a copy to Community Workforce Coordinator, within 
seven (7) calendar days thereafter.  Within seven (7) calendar days after the period allowed for 
Union notices of disagreement with the Contractor’s proposed assignments, but prior to the 
Page 193 of 1069

Coordinator shall be responsible for the scheduling of the meetings, the preparation of the 
agenda topics for the meetings, with input from the Unions the Contractors and the City.  Notice 
of the date, time and place of meetings, shall be given to the Committee members at least three 
(3) business days prior to the meeting.  The City should be notified of the meetings and invited to 
send a representative(s) to participate.  The Community Workforce Coordinator shall prepare 
quarterly reports on apprentice utilization and the training and employment of City residents, and 
a schedule of Project Work and estimated number of craft workers needed.  The Committee or an 
appropriate subcommittee, may review such reports and make any recommendations for 
improvement, if necessary, including increasing the availability of skilled trades, and the 
employment of local residents or other individuals who should be assisted with appropriate 
training to qualify for apprenticeship programs. 
 
ARTICLE 16 
SAVINGS AND SEPARABILITY  
 
Section 16.1  Savings Clause:  It is not the intention of the City, the Community Workforce 
Coordinator, Contractor or the Union parties to violate any laws governing the subject matter of 
this Agreement.  The Parties hereto agree that in the event any provision of this Agreement is 
finally held or determined to be illegal or void as being in contravention of any applicable law or 
regulation, the remainder of the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect unless the part or 
parts so found to be void are wholly inseparable from the remaining portions of this Agreement. 
Further, the Parties agree that if and when any provision(s) of this Agreement is finally held or 
determined to be illegal or void by a court of competent jurisdiction, the Parties will promptly 
enter into negotiations concerning the substantive effect of such decision for the purposes of 
achieving conformity with the requirements of any applicable laws and the intent of the Parties 
hereto.  If the legality of this Agreement is challenged and any form of injunctive relief is 
granted by any court, suspending temporarily or permanently the implementation of this 
Agreement, then the Parties agree that all Project Work that would otherwise be covered by this 
Page 194 of 1069
Page 38
City of San Luis Obispo 31 Community Workforce Agreement 
Agreement should be continued to be bid and constructed without application of this Agreement 
so that there is no delay or interference with the ongoing planning, bidding and construction of 
any Project Work. 
 
Section 16.2  Effect of Injunctions or Other Court Orders:  The Parties recognize the right of the 
City to withdraw, at its absolute discretion, the utilization of the Agreement as part of any bid 
specification should a Court of competent jurisdiction issue any order, or any applicable statute 
which could result, temporarily or permanently in delay of the bidding, awarding and/or 
construction on the Project.  Notwithstanding such an action by the City, or such court order or 
statutory provision, the Parties agree that the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect on 
covered Project Work to the maximum extent legally possible. 
 
ARTICLE 17

Agreement and shall not relieve, excuse or release any of the Parties from any of their rights, 
duties or obligations hereunder.

TRI-COUNTIES BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION 
TRADES COUNCIL  
APPROVED  
DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING POLICY 
 
 
The Parties recognize the problems which drug and alcohol abuse have created in the construction 
industry and the need to develop drug and alcohol abuse prevention programs. Accordingly, the 
Parties agree that in order to enhance the safety of the workplace and to maintain a drug and 
alcohol-free work environment, individual Employers may require applicants or employees to 
undergo drug and alcohol testing.  
 
1. It is understood that the use, possession, transfer or sale of illegal drugs, narcotics, or other 
unlawful substances, as well as being under the influence of alcohol and the possession or 
consuming alcohol is absolutely prohibited while employees are on the Employer’s job premises 
or while working on any jobsite in connection with work performed under the Community 
Workforce Agreement (“CWA”). 
 
2. No Employer may implement a drug testing program which does not conform in all 
respects to the provisions of this Policy. 
 
3. No Employer may implement drug testing at any jobsite unless written notice is given 
to the Union setting forth the location of the jobsite, a description of the project under 
construction, and the name and telephone number of the Project Supervisor. Said notice shall 
be addressed to the office of each Union signing the CWA. Said notice shall be sent by email 
or by registered mail before the implementation of drug testing. Failure to give such notice shall 
make any drug testing engaged in by the Employer a violation of the CWA, and the Employer 
may not implement any form of drug testing at such jobsite for the following six months. 
 
4. An Employer who elects to implement drug testing pursuant to this Agreement shall 
require all employees on the Project to be tested. With respect to individuals who become 
employed on the Project subsequent to the proper implementation of a valid drug testing 
program, such test shall be administered upon the commencement of employment on the 
project, whether by referral from a Union Dispatch Office, transfer from another project, or  
another method. Individuals who were employed on the project prior to t he proper 
implementation of a valid drug testing program may only be subjected to testing for the 
reasons set forth in paragraphs 5(g)(l) through 5(g)(3) and paragraphs 6(a) through 6(e) of this 
Policy. Refusal to undergo such testing shall be considered sufficient grounds to deny 
employment on the project. 
 
5. The following procedure shall apply to all drug testing: 
Page 203 of 1069
Page 47
 
City of San Luis Obispo 39 Community Workforce Agreement 
 
 
 
a. The Employer may request urine samples only. The applicant or employee shall 
not be observed when the urine specimen is given. An applicant  or employee, at his or her sole 
option, shall, upon request, receive a blood test in lieu of a urine test. No employee of the 
Employer shall draw blood from a bargaining unit employee, touch or handle urine specimens, 
or in any way become involved in the chain of custody of urine or blood specimens. A Union 
Business Representative, subject to the approval of the individual applicant or employee, shall 
be permitted to accompany the applicant or employee to the collection facility to observe  the 
collection, bottling, and sealing of the specimen. 
 
b. An employer may request an applicant to perform an alcohol breathalyzer test, at a 
certified laboratory only and cutoff levels shall be those mandated by applicable state or federal  
law. 
 
c. The testing shall be done by a laboratory approved by the Substance Abuse & 
Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), which is chosen by the Employer and the 
Union. 
 
d. An initial test shall be performed using the Enzyme Multiplied Immunoassay 
Technique (EMIT). In the event a question or positive result arises from the initial test, a 
confirmation test must be utilized before action can be taken against the applicant or employee. 
The confirmation test will be by Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS). Cutoff levels 
for both the initial test and confirmation test will be those established by SAMHSA. Should these 
SAMHSA levels be changed during the course of this Agreement or new testing procedures are 
approved, then these new regulations will be deemed as part of this existing Agreement. Confirmed 
positive samples will be retained by the testing laboratory in secured long-term frozen storage for 
a minimum of one year. Handling and transportation of each sample must be documented through 
strict chain of custody procedures. 
 
e. In the event of a confirmed positive test result the applicant or employee may 
request, within forty-eight (48) hours, a sample of his/her specimen from the testing laboratory 
for purposes of  a second test to be performed at a second laboratory, designated by the Union 
and approved by SAMHSA. The retest must be performed within ten (10) days of the request. 
Chain of custody for this sample shall be maintained by the Employer between the original 
testing laboratory and the Union's designated laboratory. Retesting shall be performed at the 
applicant’s or employee’s expense. In the event of conflicting test results the Employer may 
require a third test. 
 
f. If, as a result of the above testing procedure, it is determined that an applicant or 
employee has tested positive, this shall be considered sufficient grounds to deny the applicant or 
employee his/her employment on the project.

City of San Luis Obispo 40 Community Workforce Agreement 
g. No individual who tests negative for drugs pursuant to the above procedure and 
becomes employed on the project shall again be subjected to drug testing with the following  
exceptions: 
 
1. Employees who are involved in industrial accidents resulting in damage to 
plant, property or equipment or injury to him/her or others may be tested for drug or alcohol 
pursuant to the procedures stated hereinabove. 
 
2. The Employer may test employees following thirty (30) days advance 
written notice to the employee(s) to be tested and to the applicable Union. Notice to the applicable 
Union shall be as set forth in paragraph 3 above and such testing shall be pursuant to the procedures 
stated hereinabove.  
3. The Employer may test an employee where the Employer has reasonable 
cause to believe that the employee is impaired from performing his/her job. Reasonable cause shall 
be defined as being aberrant or unusual behavior, the type of which is a recognized and accepted 
symptom of impairment (i.e., slurred speech, unusual lack of muscular coordination, etc.). Such 
behavior must be actually observed by at least two persons, one of whom shall be a supervisor 
who has been trained to recognize the symptoms of drug abuse or impairment and the other 
of whom shall be the Job Steward. If the Job Steward is unavailable or there is no Job Steward 
on the project the other person shall be  a member of the applicable Union’s bargaining unit. 
Testing shall be pursuant to the procedures stated hereinabove. Emplo yees who are tested 
pursuant to the exceptions set forth in this paragraph and who test positive will be removed 
from the Employer's payroll. 
 
h.  Applicants or employees who do not test positive shall be paid for all time lost 
while undergoing drug testing. Payment shall be at the applicable wage and benefit rates set 
forth in the applicable Union’s Master Labor Agreement. Applicants who have been dispatched 
from the Union and who are not put to work pending the results of a test will be paid waiting 
time until such time as they are put to work. It is understood that an applicant must pass the 
test as a condition of employment. Applicants who are put to work pending the results of a 
test will be considered probationary employees. 
 
6. The Employers will be allowed to conduct periodic jobsite drug testing on the Project 
under the following conditions: 
 
a. The entire jobsite must be tested, including any employee or subcontractor's 
employee who worked on that project three (3) working days before or after the date of the test; 
 
b. Jobsite testing cannot commence sooner than fifteen (15) days after start of the 
work on the project; 
 
c. Prior to start of periodic testing, a Business Representative will be allowed to 
conduct an educational period on company time to explain periodic jobsite testing program to 
affected employees; 
Page 205 of 1069
Page 49
 
City of San Luis Obispo 41 Community Workforce Agreement 
 
d. Testing shall be conducted by a SAMHSA certified laboratory, pursuant to the 
provisions set forth in paragraph 5 hereinabove. 
 
e. Only two (2) periodic tests may be performed in a twelve (12) month period. 
 
7. It is understood that the unsafe use of prescribed medication, or where the use of 
prescribed medication impairs the employee's ability to perform work, is a basis for the 
Employer to remove the employee from the jobsite. 
 
8. Any grievance or dispute which may arise out of the application of this Agreement shall 
be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedures set forth in the CWA.  
 
9. The establishment or operation of this Policy shall not curtail any right of any employee  
found in any law, rule or regulation. Should any part of this Agreement be found unlawful by a 
court of competent jurisdiction or a public agency having jurisdiction over the Parties, the 
remaining portions of the Agreement shall be unaffected, and the Parties shall enter negotiations 
to replace the affected provision. 
 
10. Present employees, if tested positive, shall have the prerogative for rehabilitation program 
at the employee’s expense. When such program has been successfully completed the Employer 
shall not discriminate in any way against the employee. If work for which the employee is qualified 
exists, he/she shall be reinstated. 
 
11. The Employer agrees that results of   urine and blood tests performed hereunder will be 
considered medical records held confidential to the extent permitted or required by law. Such 
records shall not be released to any persons or entities other than designated Employer 
representatives and the applicable Union. Such release to the applicable Union shall only be 
allowed upon the signing of a written release and the information contained therein shall not be 
used to discourage the employment of the individual applicant or employee on any subsequent 
occasion. 
 
12. The Employer shall indemnify and hold the Union harmless against any and all claims, 
demands, suits, or liabilities that may arise out of the application of this Agreement and/or any 
program permitted hereunder. 
 
13. Employees who seek voluntary assistance for substance abuse may not be disciplined for 
seeking such assistance. Requests from employees for such assistance shall remain confidential 
and shall not be revealed to other employees or management personnel without the employee's 
consent. Employees enrolled in substance abuse programs will be subject to all Employer rules, 
regulations and job performance standards with the understanding that an employee enrolled in 
such a program is receiving treatment for an illness.

City of San Luis Obispo 42 Community Workforce Agreement 
14. The Parties agree to develop and implement a drug abuse prevention and testing program 
for all apprentices entering the industry. 
 
15. This Memorandum of Understanding shall constitute the only Agreement in effect between 
the Parties concerning drug and alcohol abuse, prevention and testing. Any modifications thereto 
must be accomplished pursuant to collective bargaining negotiations between the Parties.

SIDE LETTER OF AGREEMENT 
TESTING POLICY FOR DRUG ABUSE 
 
It is hereby agreed between the Parties hereto that an Employer who has otherwise properly 
implemented drug testing, as set forth in the Testing Policy for Drug Abuse, shall have the 
right to offer an applicant or employee a "quick" drug screening test. This “quick” screen test 
shall consist either of the “ICUP” urine screen or similar test or an oral screen test. The 
applicant or employee shall have the absolute right to select either of the two “quick” screen 
tests, or to reject both and request a full drug test. 
 
An applicant or employee who selects one of the "quick" screen tests, and who passes the 
test, shall be put to work immediately. An applicant or employee who fails the "quick" screen 
test, or who rejects the "quick" screen tests, shall be tested pursuant to the procedures set forth 
in the Testing Policy for Drug Abuse. The sample used for the "quick" screen test shall be 
discarded immediately upon conclusion of the test. An applicant or employee shall not be 
deprived of any rights granted to them by the Testing Policy for Drug Abuse as a result of any 
occurrence related to the “quick” screen test.
